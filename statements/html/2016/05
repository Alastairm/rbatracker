								At its meeting today, the Board decided to lower the
								cash rate by 25&nbsp;basis points to 1.75&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent, effective
								4 May 2016. This follows information showing inflationary
								pressures are lower than expected.
							</p>
							<p>
								The global economy is continuing to grow, though at
								a slightly lower pace than earlier expected, with forecasts
								having been revised down a little further recently.
								While several advanced economies have recorded improved
								conditions over the past year, conditions have become
								more difficult for a number of emerging market economies.
								China's growth rate moderated further in the first
								part of the year, though recent actions by Chinese policymakers
								are supporting the near-term outlook.
							</p>
							<p>
								Commodity prices have firmed noticeably from recent
								lows, but this follows very substantial declines over
								the past couple of years. Australia's terms of
								trade remain much lower than they had been in recent
								years.
							</p>
							<p>
								Sentiment in financial markets has improved, after a
								period of heightened volatility early in the year. However,
								uncertainty about the global economic outlook and policy
								settings among the major jurisdictions continues. Funding
								costs for high-quality borrowers remain very low and,
								globally, monetary policy remains remarkably accommodative.
							</p>
							<p>
								In Australia, the available information suggests that
								the economy is continuing to rebalance following the
								mining investment boom. GDP growth picked up over 2015,
								particularly in the second half of the year, and the
								labour market improved. Indications are that growth
								is continuing in 2016, though probably at a more moderate
								pace. Labour market indicators have been more mixed
								of late.
							</p>
							<p>
								Inflation has been quite low for some time and recent
								data were unexpectedly low. While the quarterly data
								contain some temporary factors, these results, together
								with ongoing very subdued growth in labour costs and
								very low cost pressures elsewhere in the world, point
								to a lower outlook for inflation than previously forecast.
							</p>
							<p>
								Monetary policy has been accommodative for quite some
								time. Low interest rates have been supporting demand
								and the lower exchange rate overall has helped the traded
								sector. Credit growth to households continues at a moderate
								pace, while that to businesses has picked up over the
								past year or so. These factors are all assisting the
								economy to make the necessary economic adjustments,
								though an appreciating exchange rate could complicate
								this.
							</p>
							<p>
								In reaching today's decision, the Board took careful
								note of developments in the housing market, where indications
								are that the effects of supervisory measures are strengthening
								lending standards and that price pressures have tended
								to abate. At present, the potential risks of lower interest
								rates in this area are less than they were a year ago.
							</p>
							<p>
								Taking all these considerations into account, the Board
								judged that prospects for sustainable growth in the
								economy, with inflation returning to target over time,
								would be improved by easing monetary policy at this
								meeting.
