								At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.50 per
								cent.
							</p>
							<p>
								The global economy is continuing to grow, at a lower than average pace. Several advanced
								economies have recorded improved conditions over the past year, but conditions have
								become more difficult for a number of emerging market economies. Actions by Chinese
								policymakers have been supporting growth, but the underlying pace of China's
								growth appears to be moderating.
							</p>
							<p>
								Commodity prices are above recent lows, but this follows very substantial declines over
								the past couple of years. Australia's terms of trade remain much lower than they
								had been in recent years.
							</p>
							<p>
								Financial markets have continued to function effectively. Funding costs for high-quality
								borrowers remain low and, globally, monetary policy remains remarkably accommodative.
							</p>
							<p>
								In Australia, recent data suggest that overall growth is continuing, despite a very
								large decline in business investment, helped by growth in other areas of domestic demand
								and exports. Labour market indicators continue to be somewhat mixed, but suggest
								continued expansion in employment in the near term.
							</p>
							<p>
								Inflation remains quite low. Given very subdued growth in labour costs and very low cost
								pressures elsewhere in the world, this is expected to remain the case for some time.
							</p>
							<p>
								Low interest rates have been supporting domestic demand and the lower exchange rate
								since 2013 is helping the traded sector. Financial institutions are in a position to
								lend for worthwhile purposes. These factors are all assisting the economy to make the
								necessary economic adjustments, though an appreciating exchange rate could complicate
								this.
							</p>
							<p>
								Supervisory measures have strengthened lending standards in the housing market.
								Separately, a number of lenders are also taking a more cautious attitude to lending in
								certain segments. The best available information suggests that dwelling prices overall
								have risen moderately over the past year and growth in lending for housing purposes has
								slowed. Considerable supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream over the next
								couple of years, particularly in the eastern capital cities.
							</p>
							<p>
								Taking account of the available information, and having eased monetary policy at its May
								and August meetings, the Board judged that holding the stance of policy unchanged at
								this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving
								the inflation target over time.
