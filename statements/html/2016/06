								At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.75&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent.
							</p>
							<p>

								The global economy is continuing to grow, at a lower than average pace. Several advanced
								economies have recorded improved conditions over the past year, but conditions have
								become more difficult for a number of emerging market economies. China's growth
								rate moderated further in the first part of the year, though recent actions by Chinese
								policymakers are supporting the near-term outlook.
							</p>
							<p>

								Commodity prices are above recent lows, but this follows very substantial declines over
								the past couple of years. Australia's terms of trade remain much lower than they
								had been in recent years.
							</p>
							<p>

								In financial markets, conditions have generally been calmer for the past several months
								following the period of volatility early in the year. Attention is now turning to some
								particular event risks. Funding costs for high-quality borrowers remain very low and,
								globally, monetary policy remains remarkably accommodative.
							</p>
							<p>

								In Australia, recent data suggest overall growth is continuing, despite a very large
								decline in business investment. Other areas of domestic demand, as well as exports, have
								been expanding at a pace at or above trend. Labour market indicators have been more
								mixed of late, but are consistent with continued expansion of employment in the near
								term.
							</p>
							<p>

								Inflation has been quite low. Given very subdued growth in labour costs and very low
								cost pressures elsewhere in the world, this is expected to remain the case for some
								time.
							</p>
							<p>

								Low interest rates have been supporting domestic demand and the lower exchange rate
								overall is helping the traded sector. Over the past year, growth in credit to businesses
								has picked up, even as that to households has moderated a little. These factors are all
								assisting the economy to make the necessary economic adjustments, though an appreciating
								exchange rate could complicate this.
							</p>
							<p>

								Indications are that the effects of supervisory measures have strengthened lending
								standards in the housing market. Separately, a number of lenders are also taking a more
								cautious attitude to lending in certain segments. Dwelling prices have begun to rise
								again recently. But considerable supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream
								over the next couple of years, particularly in the eastern capital cities.
							</p>
							<p>
								Taking account of the available information, and having eased monetary policy at its May
								meeting, the Board judged that holding the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting
								would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and inflation returning to
								target over time.
