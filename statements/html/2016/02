								At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the
								cash rate unchanged at 2.0 per cent.
							</p>
							<p>
								Recent information suggests the global economy is continuing
								to grow, though at a slightly lower pace than earlier
								expected. While several advanced economies have recorded
								improved growth over the past year, conditions have
								become more difficult for a number of emerging market
								economies. China's growth rate has continued to
								moderate.
							</p>
							<p>
								Commodity prices have declined further, especially oil
								prices. This partly reflects slower growth in demand
								but also very substantial increases in supply over recent
								years. The decline in Australia's terms of trade,
								which began more than four years ago, has therefore
								continued.
							</p>
							<p>
								Financial markets have once again exhibited heightened
								volatility recently, as participants grapple with uncertainty
								about the global economic outlook and diverging policy
								settings among the major jurisdictions. Appetite for
								risk has diminished somewhat and funding conditions
								for emerging market sovereigns and lesser-rated corporates
								have tightened. But funding costs for high-quality borrowers
								remain very low and, globally, monetary policy remains
								remarkably accommodative.
							</p>
							<p>
								In Australia, the available information suggests that
								the expansion in the non-mining parts of the economy
								strengthened during 2015 even as the contraction in
								spending in mining investment continued. Surveys of
								business conditions moved to above average levels, employment
								growth picked up and the unemployment rate declined
								in the second half of the year, even though measured
								GDP growth was below average. The pace of lending to
								businesses also picked up.
							</p>
							<p>
								Inflation continues to be quite low, with the CPI rising
								by 1.7 per cent over 2015. This was partly caused by
								declining prices for oil and some utilities, but underlying
								measures of inflation are also low at about 2 per cent.
								With growth in labour costs continuing to be quite subdued
								as well, and inflation restrained elsewhere in the world,
								consumer price inflation is likely to remain low over
								the next year or two.
							</p>
							<p>
								Given these conditions, it is appropriate for monetary
								policy to be accommodative. Low interest rates are supporting
								demand, while regulatory measures are working to emphasise
								prudent lending standards and so to contain risks in
								the housing market. Credit growth to households continues
								at a moderate pace, albeit with a changed composition
								between investors and owner-occupiers. The pace of growth
								in dwelling prices has moderated in Melbourne and Sydney
								over recent months and has remained mostly subdued in
								other cities. The exchange rate has continued its adjustment
								to the evolving economic outlook.
							</p>
							<p>
								At today's meeting, the Board judged that there
								were reasonable prospects for continued growth in the
								economy, with inflation close to target. The Board therefore
								decided that the current setting of monetary policy
								remained appropriate.
							</p>
							<p>
								Over the period ahead, new information should allow
								the Board to judge whether the recent improvement in
								labour market conditions is continuing and whether the
								recent financial turbulence portends weaker global and
								domestic demand. Continued low inflation may provide
								scope for easier policy, should that be appropriate
								to lend support to demand.
