								At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the
								cash rate unchanged at 2.0 per cent.
							</p>
							<p>
								Recent information suggests that the global economy
								is continuing to grow, though at a slightly lower pace
								than earlier expected. While several advanced economies
								have recorded improved growth over the past year, conditions
								have become more difficult for a number of emerging
								market economies. China's growth rate has continued
								to moderate.
							</p>
							<p>
								Commodity prices have generally increased a little recently,
								but this follows very substantial declines over the
								past couple of years. Australia's terms of trade
								remain much lower than they had been in recent years.
							</p>
							<p>
								Sentiment in financial markets has improved recently
								after a period of heightened volatility. However, uncertainty
								about the global economic outlook and policy settings
								among the major jurisdictions continues. Funding costs
								for high-quality borrowers remain very low and, globally,
								monetary policy remains remarkably accommodative.
							</p>
							<p>
								In Australia, the available information suggests that
								the economy is continuing to rebalance following the
								mining investment boom. Consistent with developments
								in the labour market, overall GDP growth picked up over
								2015, despite the contraction in mining investment.
								The pace of lending to businesses has also picked up.
							</p>
							<p>
								Inflation is quite low. Recent information has confirmed
								that growth in labour costs remains quite subdued. Given
								this, and with inflation also restrained elsewhere in
								the world, inflation in Australia is likely to remain
								low over the next year or two.
							</p>
							<p>
								Given these conditions, it is appropriate for monetary
								policy to be accommodative. Low interest rates are supporting
								demand, while supervisory measures are working to emphasise
								prudent lending standards and so to contain risks in
								the housing market. Credit growth to households continues
								at a moderate pace, albeit with a changed composition
								between investors and owner-occupiers. The pace of growth
								in dwelling prices has moderated in Melbourne and Sydney
								and has remained mostly subdued in other cities.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Australian dollar has appreciated somewhat recently.
								In part, this reflects some increase in commodity prices,
								but monetary developments elsewhere in the world have
								also played a role. Under present circumstances, an
								appreciating exchange rate could complicate the adjustment
								under way in the economy.
							</p>
							<p>
								At today's meeting, the Board judged that there
								were reasonable prospects for continued growth in the
								economy, with inflation close to target. The Board therefore
								decided that the current setting of monetary policy
								remained appropriate.
							</p>
							<p>
								Over the period ahead, new information should allow
								the Board to assess the outlook for inflation and whether
								the improvement in labour market conditions evident
								last year is continuing. Continued low inflation would
								provide scope for easier policy, should that be appropriate
								to lend support to demand.
